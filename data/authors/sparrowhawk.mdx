G'day, I'm a software engineer with a degree in Computer Science from Murdoch University. Previously I had worked at Vix Technology as an Associate Software Engineer for over two years and currently working at Rio Tinto as a software developer.

I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and have an ambition to work in that field. I spend some time outside of work developing fun AI apps and continuously learning more about the field.

I am a hardcore gamer and die-hard sports football, basketball, gridiron and F1 fan too.
