You came here to know more about me did you? Well...there isn't much to say. I did a degree in Computer Science at Murdoch University and graduated in November 2021. I started doing some freelance coding for a software engineer who recruited me from University for his startup where I did some mobile app development and then some API development in Python.

I became very interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning when I was introduced to it in my second of my degree. Since then, I've been learning more about it in my spare time and doing side projects on the side with frameworks like Tensorflow. It is a field that I'm definitely interested in building a career in and always looking for an opportunity.

I recently also became interested in data engineering which closely ties with the AI/ML space as your models are only as good as the data you train them with and also look to have a career in alongside AI/ML.

On another note, I am an avid sports fan in soccer, NBA, NFL and F1. So if you share interest in those as well, I'm always up for a good chat.
